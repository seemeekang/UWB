 - This program takes the Anchor and Tag coordinates as inputs. 
 - It uses the Anchor and Tag coordinates to create an inter-node distance matrix.
 - Using the distance matrix and Anchor coordinate, the program recalculates the Tag coordinates. The calculations are discussed in detail [here](https://github.com/jonathanrjpereira/UWB/wiki/Trilateration).
